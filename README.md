## Hund50

Hund50 is a DIY 50% mechanical keyboard PCB, with an ortho layout. It is meant to be fairly easy to solder and assemble.

Specs:

    Uses a Pro Micro, Elite-C or Proton-C
    Cherry MX Switches, PCB or plate-mount
    Support for ISO Enter, if that is what you truly desire ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
    Uses one 2U plate or pcb-mount stabilizer
    QMK Compatible

### Making the board

If you want to have the pcb made, you can download the Hund50_rev1.zip file from the gerber folder and put that into the gerber file upload field in your favorite pcb service's website.

#### Layout

Layout files for KLE are available in the Layout folder

#### Case

Files for a sandwich style acrylic case can be found in the Case folder
