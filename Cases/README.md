# Cases

These are case files for stacked acrylic cases, meant to work with the FR4-Plate files.

The standard, straight-edged acrylic case has WKL and HHKB top variants, where as the curvy does not.

Assembly is done using M2 knurled standoffs and M2 screws. The height of these parts will be dependent on
your build's thickness, which can be varied with the amount of acrylic layers.

I've personally used M2x10 and M2x5 screws, with 14mm tall M2 knurled standoffs with the straight-edge files
using no riser feet.
